Q.7 (Savings Account Class)
Create class SavingsAccount.
Use a static variable annualInterestRate to store the annual
interest rate for all account holders. Each object of the class
contains a private instance variable savingsBalance indicating
the amount the saver currently has on deposit.
Provide method calculateMonthlyInterest to calculate the monthly
interest by multiplying the savingsBalance by annualInterestRate
divided by 12â€”this interest should be added to savings-Balance.
Provide a static method modifyInterestRate that sets the
annualInterestRate to a new value. Write a program to test class
SavingsAccount. Instantiate two savingsAccount objects,
saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00,
respectively. Set annualInterestRate to 4%, then calculate the
monthly interest for each of 12 months and print the new
